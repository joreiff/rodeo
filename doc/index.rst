Release v\ |release|.

Welcome to the official documentation of
*RODEO: Reaction Dynamics and Exceptional Orbits*,
a software package for reaction dynamics calculations
in the framework of classical transition-state theory (TST).
This software is intended to showcase
the different algorithms that have been employed or developed at
the Institute for Theoretical Physics I at the University of Stuttgart.

This project currently lacks
extensive user documentation beyond an API reference.
Interested users may instead want to have a look at
the test suite located in :git-file:`test/`
or the sample scripts in :git-file:`example/`.
